## 🌍 Story

No one forgot the day the asteroid was first spotted.

At first, it was just a distant speck in the sky, but the calculations were clear. In a matter of months, it would collide with Earth with enough force to wipe it out entirely.

Civilization collapsed. Governments fell. Cities were abandoned. Survivors fled underground, hiding in sewers and caves, clinging to the hope that stone and concrete could shield them from extinction.

Amid the chaos, one name echoed through radio waves and underground newspapers:

Dr. Ian Felinus, a renowned robotics and energy scientist, claimed he held the key to humanity’s survival.

With the world’s last remaining resources, a desperate plan was formed:
Build a vehicle capable of destroying the asteroid before impact.

But the technology needed lay scattered across abandoned zones, now guarded by autonomous security machines. Without human maintenance, these robots became merciless hunters.

Felinus’ only defense came from an unlikely source:
An old optical calibration tool that, due to a firmware flaw, could temporarily stun robots when intense light hit their cameras directly.

With every step into the ruins, one question lingered:

What if saving the world isn’t as simple as it seems?
